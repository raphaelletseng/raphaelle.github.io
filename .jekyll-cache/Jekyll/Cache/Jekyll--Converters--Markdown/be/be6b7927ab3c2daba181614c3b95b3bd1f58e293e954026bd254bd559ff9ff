I"Ç<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Raph, a final year Mathematics and Computer Science major at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada.
I am interested in exploring artificial intelligence in areas where it can affect social and environmental good, as well as the ethics of AI. Currently, I am part of the <a href="http://mcgillai.com">McGill Artificial Intelligence Society!</a>, where I have met a lovely community of humans who share and broaden my interests!</p>

<p>I drink gallons of tea, thrive in warm weather, and have a soft spot for cats.</p>

<p>Send me a message if youâ€™re interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!</p>
