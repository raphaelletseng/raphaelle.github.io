<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Raph.
This is where I occasionally write about the things that I am learning about! I am interested in everything from the ethics of AI and exploring the areas where tech can affect positive social and environmental change, to literature, art, and the outdoors.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently an Associate Consultant at <a href="https://www.slalom.com/">Slalom</a>, Montreal, Canada. I have a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from McGill University.</p>

<p>This year, I worked under <strong><a href="http://jguo-web.com/">Prof. Jin Guo</a></strong> in the <a href="http://jguo-web.com/lab.html">Knowledge and Software Technology (KAST)</a> lab, researching the impact of fairness mitigation techniques on privacy preserving Machine Learning. I also participated in the <strong><a href="https://www.ai4goodlab.com/">2021 AI4Good lab</a></strong>, where I worked on Datallite, a dashboard that uses satellite imagery to address data droughts in developing regions to better inform policies that impact social development, specifically education inequality.</p>

<p>I volunteer in my spare time as a web developer with <strong><a href="https://www.earthhero.org">Earth Hero</a></strong>, an awesome group of activists passionate about effectively responding to the climate emergency.</p>

<p>Send me a <strong><a href="mailto:raphaelletseng@gmail.com">message</a></strong> if youâ€™re interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!</p>
