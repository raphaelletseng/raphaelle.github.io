<p>I have a few pages of Giovanniâ€™s room left. I almost donâ€™t want to read them because 
I donâ€™t see what good can happen. Iâ€™m disgusted by the character of David and Iâ€™m 
disgusted by Giovanni and Hella and definitely of Jacques and Guillaume.
It feels like David, the central protagonist,
doesnâ€™t undergo any change at all throughout the novel. 
He doesnâ€™t know what heâ€™s doing at the start and he doesnâ€™t know what heâ€™s 
doing at the end. Giovanni is right when he says David doesnâ€™t love anyone but himself. 
Itâ€™s only in retrospect that he realises Giovanni is probably the only person he ever 
loved. I hate his cowardice and his lack of self determination. It makes him grotesque
and makes him act in a disgusting reprehensible manner. Giovanni I pity because he 
is debased by his love. It sort of points out all the terrible aspects of passionate 
love. He becomes weak and cowardly too. He is desperate and broken by his desire and 
becomes entirely consumed by David and his need for them to stay together. Itâ€™s tragic 
because he begins with everything going for him, everyone wanting him. Perhaps the room 
is a tangible indication of his impending tragedy.
Guillaume is a coward too, heâ€™s desperate for attention, needs to be in the centre 
of the spotlight. Heâ€™s fickle, acting as God one moment and Lucifer the next. Jacques 
lacks honesty, integrity. Heâ€™s the opposite of Giovannis innocent trust.
Hella disappoints, not because she chooses to marry, a decision that is more than 
understandable given the context and time, but because she decides to marry David,
a man with dubious morals and integrity. She understands that this marriage
is like a guilded cage and she is becoming reliant on him. Like Giovanni
says it is in her decision to return home that all intrigue of her character is removed.</p>

<p>Paris too, begins as a beautiful, exciting city. Walks along the Seine, cafÃ©s en 
terrasse, Parks and the couples walking. Then slowly it becomes this dirty bleak 
enclosing place that must be escaped at all costs.</p>

<p>The lyricism and honesty of the writing juxtaposes the insincerity 
of the characters who lie and pretend in order to navigate through the world. 
Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s tragic about it;  beneath all the lies and pretending are 
real emotions and fears and struggles and stories. I guess thatâ€™s what makes for such 
a gut wrenching tear jerking read. Itâ€™s frank and stark honesty mixed with lyrical 
depictions of the autumn leaves.</p>

<p>It resonates with the other American literature of the 1950s, as
a devastatingly honest and horrifically grotesque depiction of life when youâ€™re 
in your twenties and you donâ€™t know what lies ahead of you or where youâ€™re supposed 
to be going.</p>
