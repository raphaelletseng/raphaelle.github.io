<p>Hi, I’m Raph! <br />
This is where I occasionally write about the things that I am learning about! I am interested in everything from the ethics of AI and exploring the areas where tech can affect positive social and environmental change, to literature, art, and the outdoors.</p>

<p>I’m currently an Associate Consultant at <a href="https://www.slalom.com/">Slalom</a>, Montreal, Canada. I have a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from McGill University.</p>

<p>I volunteer in my spare time as a web developer with <strong><a href="https://www.earthhero.org">Earth Hero</a></strong>, an awesome group of activists passionate about effectively responding to the climate emergency.</p>

<p>Send me a <strong><a href="mailto:raphaelletseng@gmail.com">message</a></strong> if you’re interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!</p>
